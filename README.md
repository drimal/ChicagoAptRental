# ChicagoAptRental
In this project, I am modeling Chicago's apartment rental price with the scraped data from the craigslist apartment listings.
I use exploratory analysis and then do some feature engineering and finally model the apartment rental price with different 
regressors and compare the result. I am also bulding an interactive flask app to deploy the model.
